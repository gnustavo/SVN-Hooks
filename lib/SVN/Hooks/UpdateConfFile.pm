=head1 SYNOPSIS

This SVN::Hooks plugin allows you to maintain the repository
configuration files under version control.

The repository configuration is usually kept in the directory C<conf>
under the directory where the repository was created. In a brand new
repository you see there the files C<authz>, C<passwd>, and
C<svnserve.conf>. It's too bad that these important files are usually
kept out of any version control system. This plugin tries to solve
this problem allowing you to keep these files versioned under the same
repository where they are used.

It's active in the C<pre-commit> and the C<post-commit> hooks.

It's configured by the following directive.

=head2 UPDATE_CONF_FILE(FROM, TO, @ARGS)

This directive makes that after a successful commit in which the file
FROM, under version control, have been added or modified, its newest
version is copied to TO.

FROM can be a string or a qr/Regexp/ specifying the file path relative
to the repository's root (e.g. "trunk/src/version.c" or
"qr:^conf/(\w+).conf$:").

TO must be a relative path indicating where the original file must be copied
to below the C</repo/conf> directory in the server. It can be an explicit
file name or a directory, in which case the basename of FROM is used as the
name of the destination file. Non-existing directory components of TO are
automatically created.

Note that if the path doesn't exist the hook assumes that it should be a
file. To make sure it's understood as a directory you may end it with a
forward slash (/).

If FROM is a qr/Regexp/, TO is evaluated as a string in order to allow
for the interpolation of capture buffers from the regular
expression. This is useful to map the copy operation to a different
directory structure. For example, this configuration
"qr:^conf/(\w+).conf$: => '$1.conf'" updates any .conf file in the
repository conf directory.

The optional @ARGS must be a sequence of pairs like these:

=over

=item validator => ARRAY or CODE

A validator is a function or a command (specified by an array of
strings that will be passed to the shell) that will check the contents
of FROM in the pre-commit hook to see if it's valid. If there is no
validator, the contents are considered valid.

The function receives three arguments:

=over

=item A string with the contents of FROM

=item A string with the relative path to FROM in the repository

=item An SVN::Look object representing the commit transaction

=back

The command is called with three arguments:

=over

=item The path to a temporary copy of FROM

=item The relative path to FROM in the repository

=item The path to the root of the repository in the server

=back

=item generator => ARRAY or CODE

A generator is a function or a command (specified by an array of
strings that will be passed to the shell) that will transform the
contents of FROM in the post-commit hook before copying it to TO. If
there is no generator, the contents are copied as is.

The function receives the same three arguments as the validator's
function above.

The command is called with the same three arguments as the validator's
command above.

=item actuator => ARRAY or CODE

An actuator is a function or a command (specified by an array of
strings that will be passed to the shell) that will be invoked after a
successful commit of FROM in the post-commit hook.

The function receives the same three arguments as the validator's
function above.

The command is called with the same three arguments as the validator's
command above.

=item rotate => NUMBER

By default, after each successful commit the TO file is overwritten by
the new contents of FROM. With this option, the last NUMBER versions
of TO are kept on disk with numeric suffixes ranging from C<.0> to
C<.NUMBER-1>. This can be useful, for instance, in case you manage to
commit a wrong authz file that denies any subsequent commit.

=item remove => BOOL

By default, if FROM is B<deleted> in the commit, nothing happens to
TO. If you want to have the file TO removed from the repository when
FROM is deleted, set this option to a true value such as '1'.
