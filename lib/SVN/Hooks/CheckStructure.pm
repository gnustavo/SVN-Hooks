=head1 SYNOPSIS

This SVN::Hooks plugin checks if the files and directories added to
the repository are allowed by its structure definition. If they don't,
the commit is aborted.

It's active in the C<pre-commit> hook.

It's configured by the following directive.

=head2 CHECK_STRUCTURE(STRUCT_DEF)

This directive enables the checking, causing the commit to abort if it
doesn't comply.

The STRUCT_DEF argument specify the repository strucure with a
recursive data structure consisting of one of:

=over

=item ARRAY REF

An array ref specifies the contents of a directory. The referenced
array must contain a pair number of elements. Each pair consists of a
NAME_DEF and a STRUCT_DEF. The NAME_DEF specifies the name of the
component contained in the directory and the STRUCT_DEF specifies
recursively what it must be.

The NAME_DEF specifies a name in one of these ways:

=over

=item STRING

A string specifies a name directly.

=item REGEXP

A regexp specifies the class of names that match it.

=item NUMBER

A number may be used as an else-clause. A non-zero number means that
any name not yet matched by the previous pair must conform to the
associated STRUCT_DEF.

A zero means that no name will do and signals an error. In this case,
if the STRUCT_DEF is a string it is used as a help message shown to
the user.

=back

If no NAME_DEF matches the component being looked for, then it is a
structure violation and the commit fails.

=item STRING

A string must be one of 'FILE' and 'DIR', specifying what the current
component must be.

=item NUMBER

A non-zero number simply tells that whatever the current component is
is ok and finishes the check successfully.

A zero tells that whatever the current component is is a structure
violation and aborts the commit.

=back

Now that we have this semi-formal definition off the way, let's try to
understand it with some examples.

	my $tag_rx    = qr/^[a-z]+-\d+\.\d+$/; # e.g. project-1.0
	my $branch_rx = qr/^[a-z]+-/;	# must start with letters and hifen
	my $project_struct = [
	    'META.yml'    => 'FILE',
	    'Makefile.PL' => 'FILE',
	    ChangeLog     => 'FILE',
	    LICENSE       => 'FILE',
	    MANIFEST      => 'FILE',
	    README        => 'FILE',
	    t => [
		qr/\.t$/  => 'FILE',
	    ],
	    lib => 'DIR',
	];

	CHECK_STRUCTURE(
	    [
		trunk => $project_struct,
		branches => [
		    $branch_rx => $project_rx,
		],
		tags => [
		    $tag_rx => $project_rx,
		],
	    ],
	);

The structure's first level consists of the three usual directories:
C<trunk>, C<tags>, and C<branches>. Anything else in this level is
denied.

Below the C<trunk> we allow some usual files and two directories only:
C<lib> and C<t>. Below C<trunk/t> we may allow only test files with
the C<.t> extension and below C<lib> we allow anything.

We require that each branch and tag have the same structure as the
C<trunk>, which is made easier by the use of the C<$project_struct>
variable. Moreover, we impose some restrictions on the names of the
tags and the branches.

=head1 EXPORT

=head2 check_structure(STRUCT_DEF, PATH)

SVN::Hooks::CheckStructure exports a function to allow for the
verification of path structures outside the context of a Subversion
hook. (It would probably be better to take this function to its own
module and use that module here. We'll take care of that eventually.)

The function check_structure takes two arguments. The first is a
STRUCT_DEF exactly the same as specified for the CHECK_STRUCTURE
directive above. The second is a PATH to a file which will be checked
against the STRUCT_DEF.

The function returns true if the check succeeds and dies with a proper
message otherwise.

The function is intended to check paths as they're shown by the 'svn
ls' command, i.e., with no leading slashes and with a trailing slash
to indicate directories. The leading slash is assumed if it's missing,
but the trailing slash is needed to indicate directories.
